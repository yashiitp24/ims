This Inventory Management System (IMS) is a comprehensive web-based application built using Flask and SQLite, designed to simplify and streamline the process of managing products, stock levels, billing, and user operations for small-scale businesses or shops.

The system enables individual users to:

Securely register and log in

Add, edit, and delete products from their personal inventory

Track stock levels and receive alerts for low inventory

Generate and store bills/receipts for customer purchases

Access complete billing history

View dashboard statistics like total products, total sales this month, and total receipts this month

Edit profile details including personal info

All features are strictly user-specific, ensuring that each logged-in user can only access their own inventory, billing, and sales data.

Additional front-end features include:

A modern UI with dark mode toggle

Live search and sorting for products and stocks

Client-side validations and confirmation modals for smooth user experience

This project is fully functional and ideal for deployment in small retail environments, offering a lightweight yet powerful tool to manage day-to-day inventory and billing tasks.
